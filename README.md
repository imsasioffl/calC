# Simple Online Calculator

This is a basic online calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on two numbers.

## Features

- **Input Fields**: Enter the first number, choose an operator, and enter the second number.
- **Get Result Button**: Calculates the result based on the selected operator.
- **Reset Button**: Clears all input fields and the result display.
- **Result Display**: Shows the result of the arithmetic operation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (for styling)
- TypeScript (for interactive functionality)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter a number in the "num 1" input field.
4. Choose an operator (+, -, *, /) in the "operator" input field.
5. Enter a number in the "num 2" input field.
6. Click on the "Get Result" button to see the calculated result.
7. Click on the "Reset" button to clear all input fields and the result display.

## Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the structure and basic elements of the web application.
- **styles.css**: Stylesheet file for styling the elements.
- **script.ts**: TypeScript file for implementing interactive functionality like calculating and resetting.

## Development

To make modifications or enhancements:

1. Edit `index.html` for any changes in the structure or layout.
2. Modify `styles.css` for styling adjustments.
3. Update `script.ts` to add new features or improve existing functionality.
4. Compile TypeScript (`script.ts`) to JavaScript (`script.js`) using a TypeScript compiler like `tsc` before testing.
